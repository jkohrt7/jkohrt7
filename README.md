## Hey There! 

- I'm Jared Kohrt, or @jkohrt7. I'm an amateur Web dev learning to use the MERN stack, Django, and AWS. I've got a wide range of interests, though I particularly enjoy developing with WebGL and exploring intersections between biology and computer science. I've even made a web app for visualizing dual-RNA transcript data, though the paper on it hasn't been published yet and won't appear here for a bit.

- I'm currently enrolled in evening classes at UNC to pick up some more web-development skills while I look for a job. I'm a decent Java programmer, but web technologies are what I'm genuinely interested in using. I'll hopefully have more JS and Python projects to show off by the end of the year.
