- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jkohrt7
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a little bit of everything--I've made an app for processing dual-RNA Transcript data with R, worked on a cellular automaton for simulating HIV, 
made a few video games with C# and Unity, and have done a bit of web development with the MERN stack.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with Django and React. I still find MERN a bit complicated--I've only done a bit of JS in the past--and Django has (so far) been 
more approachable.
